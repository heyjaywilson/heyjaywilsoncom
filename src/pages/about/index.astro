      />I currently work at an early stage <a

      shipping <a href="https://blueprint.heyjaywilson.com" target="_blank"

      I used to use YouTube and Instagram as a way to showcase that I knew how
      to code so that I could transition into a software development role. I still make content around software egnineering and building iOS apps but it's less frequent and more of a creative outlet for me now.

      A good place to find me is at a coffee shop. I enjoy well roasted coffee and love
      supporting local shops and roasteries. Usually I find at least one shop to
      go to while traveling. If I'm at home, I'll normally bring my laptop with
      me to finish whatever task I'm working on.

    <p>
      This website is treated more like a digital garden, but I still show
      everything in chronological order, especially as I get more posts and
      thoughts added in.
