## Quick facts

- Pronouns: He/Him
- Working hours: 8am - 5pm Central Time
- Current Role: iOS Developer
- Preferred communication tool: Work chat app

## Intro


I'm Jay! I live in Austin, Texas with my wife. I have 4 pets, 🐶🐶🐱🐱, that are all very needy and love being on Zoom. I like the Seattle Kraken hockey team and usually stay up way too late to watch the games. I spend a lot of freetime making apps or working with some new tech I found cool. When not doing that, my wife and I like to play board games and watch Top Chef reruns.

## Role

I'm an iOS Developer. I have a major strength in architecting SwiftUI apps using Core Data as the database. My focus is to make sure we ship a great iOS app that users enjoy using.

## Working Style

I like to work *with* people to make products. This means open collaboration and communication is something I want to happen as much as possible. I am very open to feedback of any kind.

> **My work style**

> I like to work with other people and really value open communication and collaboration.

### 🙏 My values

**Humans are first**

I like to know the people I work with and am genuinely interested in who you are as a person. 

**Always be Learning**

I'm always open to learning a new process, tool, or paradigm. I love learning and want to forster that with my teammates. I also know that learning and applying new ideas will cause some me to be wrong sometimes. I am perfectly fine with being wrong so please don't be afraid to tell me. My favorite ways to receive feedback are found [here](#-feedback).

**Systems over goals**

I spent a lot of time trying to acheive goals in my personal life and in that time, I've realized that acheiving goals just helps in the short term and what actually acheives success is a system. A well defined system that can also adapt when things aren't working will help get us to where we need to be. I think working on the system is sometimes just as important as working on towards the goal.

If working in a good system, each task that the system has setup should allow the goal to be hit fairly easily.

### 💪 My strengths


**Making/adjusting systems**

As I mentioned above I like systems. I take time to learn and reflect on what is and isn't working on a larger level than just myself. I also like talking with people to figure out what needs to be better.

**Swift/SwiftUI architecture**

I've been working with SwiftUI since it was announced and try to keep up with best practices as much as possible.

**iOS user expectations and experience**

I use iOS as my primary driver and a wide range of apps from indie built to instagram on a daily basis. I use apps that follow the [HIG](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/) to a T and ones that break it or don't follow it. I bring a good balance of wanting to do right by the platform and user expectation.

### 🌱 My weaknesses


**Real time feedback**

I personally am not one that likes confrontation or challenging ideas in the moment. I like to take time to think about what's being presented and collect my thoughts. This allows me to bring the my best. The issue with this is that sometimes there isn't a lot of time to do this. If you need my thoughts faster, then please let me know.

## Communication


Time for how I think about communication.

### 📺 Channels


**Matrix**(chat app) - I keep this open all the time and it's the best way to get ahold of me

**Email** - I only check this once or twice a day

**Zoom/Google Meets** - I'm always down for a quick video chat if you think it'll help solve the problem sooner or if you just want to say hi!

**GitHub/Notion/Google Docs** - I check these a few times a day and prefer having issue specific conversations there. Keep conversation close to where the issue was raised. If it bleeds into Matrix or email, then let's make sure to document where appropriate.

### 🕖 Time


I work from 8am Central to 5pm Central Monday through Thursday. I usually have meetings in the morning and leave my mornings empty for more meetings and non-focused work. I try to respect your working hours as much as possible as well, but if you see a message from me outside of your working hours, please feel the need to ignore until you are "clocked in."

### 🏁 Following up


I try to follow up as privately as possible. I like the same as well. If you're waiting for an answer from me, please give me a ping.

## 📈 Feedback


When giving me feedback, here are some motivators and demotivators.

### 🐇 Motivators

- Public praise is totally a-okay by me
- 1 on 1 praise is also a-okay
- I like acknowledgement that something was done right

### 🐢 Demotivators

- Criticizing feedback in public is the biggest demotivator for me

## 🏗️ Working Together


🤝 Working on a team
{/* > What roles do you like to play on the team? */}

{/* > What do you appreciate the most from teammates? */}
What do I appreciate the most from teammates?

- Openness to collaborating
- Feedback about how I can improve collaboration

I love working on a team and collaborating. As part of a team together, I will help document and communicate as needed. If you're on a team with me, please let me know what I can to improve our collaboration. Besides feedback, the best thing a teammate can do is be open to ideas and share what they are thinking.

## Notes

- If I communicate outside your working hours, do not feel you need to respond right then. Working aync and across timezones means communication happens when it happens.
