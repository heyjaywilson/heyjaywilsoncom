## Intro

I'm Jay! I live in Austin, Texas with my wife. I have 4 pets, 🐶🐶🐱🐱, that are all very needy and love being on Zoom. I like the Seattle Kraken hockey team and usually stay up way too late to watch the games.

## Role

I'm an iOS Developer. I have a major strength in architecting SwiftUI apps using Core Data as the database. My focus is to make sure we ship a great iOS app that users enjoy using.

## Values

These values are what I try to hold myself to as I work.
