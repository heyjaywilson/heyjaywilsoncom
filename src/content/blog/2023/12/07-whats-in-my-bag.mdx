Here's what I take with me when I work. I try to keep it small and light.

Here are links to everything mentioned in the video.

- The bag: [Wandrd Roam 6L Sling](https://geni.us/wandrd6lsling)
- The laptop: [MacBook Pro 14" M1 Max](https://geni.us/cctplus-m3max) (similar spec but it's the m3 model)
- The camera: [Sony RX100 VII](https://geni.us/cctpocketcam)
- Accessories:
  - [AirPod Pros](https://geni.us/0r2ZG)
  - [Anker battery pack](https://geni.us/AWJhN)

The choice to not bring any type of plug to recharge is really hard sometimes, but I usually choose not to due to the Anker battery pack and my computerâ€™s battery life holding about 4 hours of charge while running Xcode betas. It has enough punch to recharge my laptop at least once while still having some room to charge my phone if needed.
