## Goals for the week

- ❌ Finish backups and imports in [Blueprint](https://blueprint.heyjaywilson.com/)
    - I ended up only doing backups this week, so it'll carry over to next week
- ✅ Figure out issue with `@FetchRequest` and why it’s resetting
    - This was due to an `@EnvironmentObject` property changing when it wasn't even needed in the view
