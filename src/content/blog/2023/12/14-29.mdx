As I approach 30, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the past year and share some of my experiences and lessons learned. This year has been quite a ride, filled with personal growth, health transformations, and exciting adventures.

## Embracing the Year of Health

When I kicked off this year, I declared it as my "Year of Health." I wanted to focus on both my mental and physical well-being. And let me tell you, it has been a game-changer. I prioritized my mental health by seeking therapy and making it a regular part of my self-care routine. The impact it had on my confidence and ability to communicate my needs has been incredible.

In terms of physical health, I set a goal to close my Apple watch rings every day. While I may have missed one stand hour along the way, I can proudly say that I've closed the move and exercise ring EVERY SING DAY. Not only have I shed some weight, but I've also gained muscle and improved my overall fitness level. Taking a mindful approach to my eating habits has been key, focusing on nourishing my body with healthier choices.

## Balancing Priorities and Realigning Goals

As I dove deeper into my health journey, I had to make some tough choices and reprioritize certain aspects of my life. Streaming on Twitch, which used to be a regular activity, had to take a backseat. Instead, I focused on nurturing my relationship with my wife and exploring new hobbies. It's all about finding that balance and understanding that it's okay to take breaks and adjust our commitments as needed.

## Navigating the Startup Life

Professionally, this year marked my entry into the world of early-stage startups. It has been an eye-opening experience, filled with challenges and growth opportunities. Collaborating with a remote team and figuring out the intricacies of async collaboration has been a learning curve. But the satisfaction of working on meaningful projects and making a positive impact on people's lives is great.

## Looking Ahead to Year 30

I can't help but feel a sense of excitement for what Year 30 has in store. I'm grateful for the lessons learned, the personal growth achieved, and the moments of joy experienced along the way. This blog post is just a glimpse into my journey, and I'm eager to see what the future holds.

Stay tuned for more updates and reflections!
