I always forget how to do this and luckily [Natalie Panferova](https://twitter.com/natpanferova) at [Nilcoalescing](https://nilcoalescing.com/) wrote a great [article](https://nilcoalescing.com/blog/UserFriendlyDescriptionsAndRecoverySuggestionsForCustomErrorsInSwift/) about how to provide user friendly descriptions and how to catch specific error types.

I'm mainly writing this so I have access to the part of that article that I forget, which is how to catch a specific error type.

```swift
do {
    // Some type of work here
} catch let error as ErrorTypeYouWantToCatch {
    // Do something with that error
} catch {
    // Don't forget to have a catchall incase the
    // error isn't what you expected
}
```

Some benefits to catching error types is to present proper user facing notifications or to make the logger calls more useful to you as the developer.
