Here's everything on my desk that I use as of January 6th 2024.

<AffiliateDisclaimer />

## Desk 

The desk is made of 2 components. The table top is not made anymore but it's solid wood from IKEA and the legs are from Autonomous

- [Autonomous smart desk pro frame](https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks/diy-smart-desk-kit?option16=38&option17=41). This allows my desk to be a sit stand desk.

## Computer

- [MacBook Pro 14" M1 Max](https://geni.us/mBcWAX) - I purchased this computer shortly after it came out. It was a big expense, but honestly I don't see myself upgrading for awhile. The amount of productivity I would receive from the M3 chip doesn't out weigh the cost.

## Monitors

- [LG 34” Ultra wide](https://geni.us/2xG8lMp) - I did win this in a raffle in 2021 or 2020 and haven't needed to upgrade it
- [LG Dual Up](https://geni.us/9AGPlgP) - This is a new edition and love it. The vertical aspect ratio is great as a secondary or even primary monitor. I used it as a solo monitor for a bit, but now it's my secondary monitor and I still enjoy it. I can see myself acquiring a second one to replace the 34" ultra wide at some point.

## Inputs

- Elgato thunderbolt dock
- [Magic Trackpad](https://geni.us/oRMxMF)
- [Zoom 75 keyboard](https://meletrix.com/collections/zoom75-collection) - This is one of my favorite keyboards. It's got some good weight and I like the screen on it. I don't quite know how long it'll stay on my desk though since I do really like the [Lily58 Pro](https://keyhive.xyz/shop/lily58) split keyboard. 
    - [Cookies and Cream switches](https://geni.us/FNgMcNS)
    - [Biip MT3 Pro keycaps](https://geni.us/vFVWxr7)
> If you're just getting started in the mechanical keyboard hobby, then I suggest getting a Keychron Q1 instead.
- [Stream Deck](https://geni.us/N6NMrZ)
- [Cal Digit Thunderbolt 4 hub](https://geni.us/gtwAd)

## Accessories

- [iPad Mini](https://geni.us/dU1Eh) - My iPad is used as a media consumption device when at work. It's playing a podcast, music, or a youtube video at most times. It's also nice for drawing/sketching something out if I need to share it with the team.
- [Satechi iPad stand](https://geni.us/HOZBmv) - Any stand will do, but I went with this one cause I saw it in a YouTube video.
- [Traveler's notebook](https://geni.us/6yQyTr) - I use this to time block and prioritize my day
- [Spigen MagSafe mount](https://amzn.to/3RMN0Ob)
- [AirPod Pros with USB C](https://geni.us/0r2ZG)
- [BenQ ScreenBar Halo](https://geni.us/ShkXhyG)

## Audio and Video 

What's listed here is not necessary for zoom calls, but it's what I use for streaming so I also use it on my meetings.
