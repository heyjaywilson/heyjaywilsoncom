## Pick of the week

[Wandrd 6L Sling](https://geni.us/wandrd6lsling)

This bag is a sling and built to hold a camera and maybe a lense depending on your camera size. I usually am able to carry an A7IV with a Tamron 28-75mm lens and then another smaller prime lens. It also has a laptop carry option, which is ðŸ”¥ and not something I normally see in this size of bag.
